                    <p class="section-text">The Seller BackOffice is Back Marketâ€™s portal for merchants to manage listings, orders, payments, and performance. In 2024, I led the redesign of its homepage, which had been underutilised and offered little actionable value. The goal was to turn it into a mission-control hub that surfaced key tasks, insights, and sustainability metrics, aligning with strategic priorities around competitiveness and circularity.</p>

                        <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> Revealed low engagement with the homepage, with sellers preferring to bookmark operational tabs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Workshops:</strong> Identified workflow inefficiencies and over-reliance on email for urgent updates.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stakeholder discussions:</strong> Guided the redesign to prioritize competitiveness and sustainability.</li>
                        <li><strong>Benchmarking:</strong> Against other marketplaces, it highlighted opportunities for better task visibility and insights delivery.</li>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Key insights</h3>
                    <ul class="section-list">
                        <li><strong>Low adoption:</strong> The homepage was not widely used and not considered valuable by sellers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fragmentation:</strong> Disrupted workflows and obscured "circularity opportunities" due to separation between Sales and Trade-in.</li>
                        <li><strong>Email overload:</strong> Over 1 million monthly update emails caused "noise" and increased the risk of missed tasks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pricing visibility:</strong> Pricing insights were not sufficiently visible, posing a risk to competitiveness.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hidden Trade-in:</strong> The "Trade-in" feature was hard to find in navigation and not integrated into the daily seller workflow.</li>

                        <li>Opportunities block â†’ surfacing pricing and inventory insights to strengthen competitiveness.</li>
                        <li>Sustainability integration â†’ making Trade-in and avoided COâ‚‚ part of the default homepage.</li>

                                <li>Notifications reduced missed tasks, contributing to a 12% drop in support tickets related to order management.</li>

                                <li>Consolidating Sales and Trade-in reduced confusion and simplified workflows, reflected in a 10% decrease in navigation-related support queries.</li>

                    <p class="section-text">The key challenge was balancing usability, competitiveness, and sustainability within one redesign. Earlier stakeholder alignment and stronger instrumentation would have strengthened the rollout, but the project proved that a homepage can be more than an entry point: it can be a strategic hub connecting seller needs with business goals while embedding sustainability by design.</p>
