                        <li>Trust and compliance were critical to adoption. Patients needed reassurance that their data was safe, and clinicians required confidence in regulatory alignment.</li>

                    <p class="section-text">We designed a clear, patient-friendly dashboard that surfaces the most important information first. The next appointment appears at the top, followed by urgent tasks such as medication or symptom logging. This simplified view helped reduce confusion and ensured patients always knew their immediate next step.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Reminders</h3>
                    <p class="section-text">Patients could set up reminders for medication, appointments, and daily care tasks. Push notifications were integrated to ensure important actions weren't missed. The flow was kept lightweight, with minimal input required, to support users with lower digital confidence.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Messaging</h3>
                    <p class="section-text">A secure messaging channel allowed clinicians to send instructions and updates directly to patients. This feature gave patients a sense of reassurance while reducing the need for repeated phone calls or manual follow-ups from clinicians.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Symptom logging</h3>
                    <p class="section-text">Patients were able to log symptoms and daily health data through simple forms and sliders. This information was presented back as a timeline or trend view, giving clinicians visibility into patient progress between visits.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Design system and accessibility</h3>
                    <p class="section-text">The UI was built on reusable Figma components to ensure consistency and scalability. We used accessible typography, clinical blue tones from Infocare's brand, and WCAG-compliant colour contrast. Tap targets and text sizes were designed with inclusivity in mind, making the app usable across a wide patient demographic.</p>
